# 🧠 ProtoPy

**ProtoPy** is a curated collection of functional Python mini-projects. These small apps explore artificial intelligence, logic-based reasoning, automation, and GUI-based real-time communication — built as part of a hands-on learning journey.

## 📘 What's Inside?

This repo includes:

- 🤖 **AI Assistant** – A voice-activated Python assistant  
- 🧠 **Expert System** – A logic-driven Q&A decision system  
- 🌍 **Language Translator** – GUI-based language translation using external APIs  
- 💬 **Real-Time Chat App (Tkinter)** – A Python desktop chat application with a server-client architecture and a GUI built in Tkinter  
- ⚙️ **Other Utilities** – More intelligent Python-based tools

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Practice building smart and reactive systems in Python  
- Learn foundational AI, NLP, and logic programming  
- Build GUI-based desktop tools using Tkinter  
- Prototype apps that mimic real-world tech, like chat clients or assistants
